<h1>Top three best animes</h1>
<h2>according to Chibuzor Udoma</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>
This is an excellent anime by Tite Kubo originating from the manga series Bleach. The anime is half way through but is more or less likely the if not one of the most popular animations out there.
</p>
<h4>Top three strongest in bleach</h4>
<p>
    1. Ichigo<br/>
    2. yhwach<br/>
    3. renji<br/>
</p>

<h3>Jojo bizzere adventures</h3>
<p>
Jojo great. It's a really well crafted show, considering it's a manga adaptation. It rarely strays from the manga, and when it does, it never affects the story. It is deserving of its TV-MA rating, however, so viewer discretion is advised if you're watching it completely uncensored. Also, yes yes yes oh my god.
